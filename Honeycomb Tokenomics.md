### 5. Honeycomb Tokenomics
$COMB is an integral part of the Honeycomb ecosystem. The token is used to organically grow the protocol, with a participatory business model where investors = users. Economic incentives are provided for users to act in the best interest of the protocol, and users can earn $COMB as a form of economic reward. 

For instance, $COMB and $NECTAR holders can stake in the Credit Swap liquidity pool to provide liquidity, and as a reward for doing so, receive a share of profits. Additionally, a Liquidity Provider must also obtain $NECTAR, which puts an upward pressure on credit, improving the overall Debt-to-Credit health. Fees become cheaper, which encourages more people to take on more debt, thereby increasing protocol revenues. Some of this increased revenue which will go towards treasury spending aimed at continuously improving the protocol. This is Honeycomb’s flywheel – one which results in much stickier user adoption and continuous growth.

#### 5.1Fee Allocation
With full transparency, the protocol fees earned during the minting of $HONEY, withdrawal of reserve currency and conversion between $COMB and $HONEY will be split equally in three ways where:
- The first portion will be reinvested back into the Honeycomb protocol, to maintain the ecosystem.
- The second portion will be deposited into Honeycomb’s treasury, to be used to fund future dApps that will promote growth of the ecosystem.
- The last portion will be used to fund the staking of rewards.

#### 5.2 $COMB Use Case
**Payments**: $COMB is used as a form of protocol currency to make payment for Honeycomb services such as minting, withdrawal and conversion.
**Credit Swap Facility**:  Liquidity providers lock their $NECTAR and $COMB in the Credit Swap liquidity pool.  In return, they will receive a share of revenue generated from fees. 
**Liquidity Converter**:  $COMB is used to maintain the stability of $HONEY by providing arbitrageurs with risk-free profit through the conversion of $COMB and $HONEY. 
**Rewards/Incentives**: Users will be rewarded with $COMB as a form of incentive that will positively benefit the Honeycomb ecosystem.
