### 2. Introduction
#### 2.1 The Problem

Alongside vast improvements in technology in the last decade, the financial services industry has experienced significant digital advancements. Innovations in the financial sector have however failed to make a significant impact on the lives of the marginalized, for whom access to capital is still a distant illusion. In particular, women, young adults and people living in poverty are disproportionately underserved [^1]. 

It is known in TradFi that the process of attaining credit utilizes archaic methods such as credit scoring to decide a borrower’s riskiness. In addition, credit processes are excessively complex, resulting in a lengthy process with unnecessary high fees. This means that it is uneconomical to provide small loans. Moreover, the decision-making process is opaque and unpredictable. Oftentimes, rules are dictated by those in control, creating a misalignment of incentives between institutions and their participants.

As a result, TradFi has historically excluded a majority of individuals – those not considered wealthy and those who never had the opportunity to accumulate a proper credit history. More than 1.7 billion people today are unable to receive financial services from traditional institutions in any capacity [^1].

While various Fintech companies have improved access to financial services and tout their own advantages, many of them are still heavily verticalized [^2] and have carried forward inefficient processes from TradFi. For example, many peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms still rely on credit scores to approve loans. This is a significant obstacle for those who do not live in countries equipped with proper informational financial infrastructures. Furthermore, P2P lending is considered an unsecured loan, exposing borrowers to higher interest rates so as to compensate lenders for the risk.

Built on the blockchain and utilizing smart contracts, Decentralised Finance (DeFi) was introduced to reinvent TradFi services. In DeFi, financial transactions are powered by smart contracts, eliminating intermediaries, thereby reducing the cost and friction experienced in TradFi. DeFi opens up a myriad of financial possibilities for those who have been traditionally outcast by TradFi, while remaining open to those who live in countries with strong financial infrastructure and who already have access to financial products. 

In the current DeFi lending model, access to capital demands over-collateralization, which is deemed both necessary to overcome extreme volatility and as an incentive to repay the loan. This status quo is capital inefficient and costly as it prevents wider adoption and can only target a small market that requires lenders who also want to borrow. To add on, its model is financially exclusive as it falsely assumes that capital is easily available to everyone.

To overcome these barriers, new DeFi protocols have come up with innovative solutions to offer under-collateralized loans. Such examples include flash loans, leveraged yield farming, leveraged trading and NFT collateral. However, these approaches still exclude those who have been traditionally underbanked.  Flash loans, leveraged yield farming, leveraged trading are catered towards the speculative market, while NFT collateral requires owning a highly speculative and illiquid asset which the financially marginalized do not have access to. In essence, DeFi’s over-collateralization model does not advance financial inclusion for those who need it the most.

#### 2.2 The Solution

Honeycomb Protocol addresses the above-mentioned shortcomings by leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts to create Credit Money and a decentralized stable coin which is used as a medium of exchange. With Web 3.0, Honeycomb is able to re-define and democratize how credit money is created and managed. 

Unlike how traditional banks create credit money that they ultimately own, Honeycomb gives credit ownership to users of the protocol. This means that each user of the protocol has full control of their credit, which gives them the autonomy to choose what to do with it. Users have the option to stake and earn protocol fees, or to swap their credit in an exchange, or to borrow against their credit. Our team at Apiary Labs hopes to empower society, so that anyone anywhere can freely access capital without being inhibited by elements outside of their control.
