# Honeycomb Lite Paper V1

## Introduction
The growth of an economy is mainly driven by productivity growth and credit. In particular, credit acts as steroids which enables borrowers to consume more than what they have today which drives the economy. More importantly, it helps boost productivity as it moves money to where it is needed the most creating market efficient outcomes.

However, the concept of *decentralized credit* - like how it is created through the fractional reserve banking system - is non-existent. In the new decentralized paradigm, Bitcoin represents a store of value and a high quality reserve asset. Layer 1 chains are “*new nation states*”[^1] where their native tokens represents money used for transactions.

Honeycomb is building on top of the decentralized lego block by introducing *decentralized credit* to fuel economic growth and freedom for the people.

### Problem
The two biggest problems with credit creation is that they are *dictated by people in power* and they *exclude billions of people* from the global economy.

Traditionally, credit money is created through the fractional reserve banking systems. This means large banks “*own and control*” the credit created giving them the authority to dictate the flow of capital while determining the eligibility of borrowers. While all the profits made from credit creation goes to them. 

Due to the capitalist nature to please shareholders, banks have moved to taking on riskier lending for short term profit at the expense of retail investors. This is apparent in the 2008 global financial crisis where many banks got bailed out by the US government. Wall Street walked away with hefty bonuses while mainstreet bare the brunt -  “*Privatizing Profits and Socializing Losses*”.

### Solution
Web 3 has given us the opportunity to shift from the trust-based model while re-engineering how we provide financial services in a decentralized manner. 

At Honeycomb, we are redefining how Credit is created. Instead of a centralized institution owning, controlling and profiting from credit, we are democratizing credit creation giving *ownership* to the people of the economy. This means, anyone can utilize their credit *responsibly* to either *access capital* anytime or *monetize* it.

## Value Propositiion
__Value Proposition 1: Capital Efficient__  
Honeycomb protocol is built on the blockchain with the use of algorithms and token incentive to eliminate the need for counterparty while enabling users to acquire under-collateralized loans at zero interest rates without predetermined repayment periods.

__Value Proposition 2: Frictionless__  
DeFi reduces the friction and lowers the barrier to entry for financial services through the use of the blockchain by providing low fees and instant liquidity without any form of KYC. This means, anyone can access instant capital anytime, anywhere as long as they have an internet connection and a mobile phone.

__Value Proposition 3: Sustainable yields__  
Participants with excess capital can monetize their credit by staking it which will earn them a portion of the protocol’s revenue. This is a reward for contributing to the stability of the protocol. Moreover, users will also enjoy credit growth as the community grows. 

## How Honeycomb Works?
Honeycomb Protocol is a fully automated, on-chain community driven credit protocol. It uses a four token model  – Reserve Currency, $NECTAR, $HONEY and $COMB – to facilitate interaction within its ecosystem. The four tokens and their uses are described as follows:
1. The __Reserve Currency__ is a base money used as a reserve to back-up and give value to the decentralized credit.
2. __$NECTAR__ is the core of the Honeycomb Protocol, which represents decentralized credit in the decentralized economy.
3.$HONEY is the credit money that is pegged to the reserve currency. It is minted against $NECTAR as a form of *debt*.
3. __$HONEY__ is credit money that is pegged to the reserve currency. It is minted against $NECTAR as a form of debt.
4. __$COMB__ is the protocol’s utility token that serves to capture fees, introduce stability and provide economic incentives for honeycomb stakeholders. All $COMB tokens will be minted at genesis for gradual distribution.

### Decentralized Credit
Credit exists because there are lenders who want to make their money grow and borrowers who want to spend more than what they have today. When both parties have mutual agreement and money exchanges hands, *credit is created out of thin air*.

Due to the uncertainties involving counterparty risk, banks have taken the role of lending and evolved to what is known as the fractional reserve banking system. To illustrate how credit money is created in the economy:
- Alice deposits $1000 at Bank A. 
- Bank A lends $700 to Bob. 
- Bob deposits the $700 at Bank B. 
- Bank B lends $490 to Charlie.
- Charlie deposits $490 to Bank C.

In this simple example, $1190 of credit money is created in the banking system from the initial $1000 from Alice. This whole process is repeated multiple times where banks can loan out deposits up to the minimum reserve required to grow the economy. 

Rather than banks creating credit, Honeycomb protocol uses a bonding curve algorithm to create _decentralized credit_. To demonstrate how $NECTAR is created in the decentralized economy:
- Alice deposits 333.33 ETH -  reserve currency -  in exchange for $NECTAR worth 333.33 ETH.
$$
NECTAR_A == Reserve Currency_A = 333.33 ETH
$$
- Bob deposits 333.33 ETH in exchange for $NECTAR worth 333.33 ETH.
- Alice’s $NECTAR value has now increased from $333.33 to $800.
$$
NECTAR_A = 800 ETH; Reserve Currency_A = 333.33 ETH
$$
$$
NECTAR_B == Reserve Currency_B = 333.33 ETH
$$

- Charlie deposits 333.33 UST in exchange for $NECTAR worth $333.33.
- Bob’s $NECTAR value has now increased from $333.33 to $700.
- Alice’s $NECTAR value has now increased from $800 to $1156.67.
$$
NECTAR_A = 1156.67 ETH; Reserve Currency_A = 333.33 ETH
$$
$$
NECTAR_B = 700 ETH; Reserve Currency_B = 333.33 ETH
$$
$$
NECTAR_C == Reserve Currency_C = 333.33 ETH
$$

Likewise in this example, 1190 ETH of credit is created in the crypto economy from the 1000 ETH of deposits from the 3 participants. Each new participant initially starts off with their $NECTAR equal to their deposit makeing them indifferent at the start. As the *community grows* - Bob and Charlie joins Honeycomb - so does credit. 

#### Community Growth
Credit can only grow if the community grows with it. For an individual to willingly deposit their reserve currency in exchange for $NECTAR:
- It represents their trust in the protocol through transparency where the code and transactions can be verified and audited and to ensure the enforcement of its rules.
- It is a bet on a decentralized economy where the concept of *decentralized credit* can co-exists with a decentralized currency like we see in the real economy.

#### Ownership
Before web 3, centralized banks created credit from an individual's deposit - which gives them control while profiting from loan creation. Honeycomb *democratizes* credit creation giving *ownership and control* back to the people empowering its users to manage their credit responsibly by either *accessing capital anytime* with *capital efficient borrowing* or *monetizing* it by earning protocol revenues.

### Borrowing
Traditionally, borrowing involves two parties - one with excess capital and one in need of capital. However:
- Lenders want to minimize as much of the risk yet achieve the highest yield possible to compensate for the risk they are bearing and opportunity cost they are forgoing.
- Borrowers want fuss-free access to capital with the lowest possible yield, even though they may struggle to afford it.
To address the misalignment of interests, contracts stating interest rates and predetermined repayment periods are necessary to match both borrowers and lenders. 

In short, the current status quo of borrowing is exclusive. Honeycomb introduces an inclusive way of borrowing by using an algorithm to determine their borrowing capacity rather than the use of credit scoring. In addition, the protocol eliminates the need of a counterparty. This means that interest rates and predetermined repayment periods are no longer necessary.

Instead of paying an interest, a borrower in Honeycomb pays an upfront fee that varies with the amount of debt incurred. This fee acts as a form of tax to deter excessive borrowing which may result in dire consequences. Alternative to pre-determined borrowing, a borrower maintains his debt level relative to his credit limit which provides added flexibility.

To illustrate how it $NECTAR is used for borrowing:
- Both Allice and Charlie collateralized her $NECTAR
$$
NECTAR_A =1156.67; creditline_A = 1000, Reserve Currency A = 333.33 ETH
$$
$$
NECTAR_C == creditline_C ==Reserve Currency C = 333.33 ETH 
$$
Based on the creditline determined by the algorithm, Alice mints 500 HONEY while Charlie mints 250 HONEY and pays a minting fee in $COMB
$$
\frac{debt_A}{credit_A}=0.5; \frac{debt_A}{collateral_A}=1.5
$$
$$
\frac{debtCA}{credit_C}==\frac{debt_C}{collateral_C} =0.75
$$


#### Risk Management
To ensure that all borrowers adhere to the protocol, such that their debt level does not exceed their assigned credit line. Three levels of risk management are put in place and borrowing will resume once the protocol is deemed stable.
1. Margin call is the first line of defense and is triggered when the debt level of a user surpasses 95% of the credit line. The margin call notifies the borrowers to reduce their debt level or improve their creditline.
2. Redistribution is triggered when the borrower’s $$Debt_n>creditLine_n$$. The smart contract will automatically close off the borrower’s debt position by redistributing the debt position to other existing debt holders. Concurrently, other debt holders will inherit the liquidated $NECTAR pro-rata as a compensation for taking on more debt, and they will experience a net positive benefit.
3. The Circuit Breaker acts as the last line of defense to prevent cascading liquidation and is triggered when the overall debt in the protocol exceeds the overall credit available. When Circuit Breaker is in force, all operations that would worsen the health of the protocol will be temporarily disabled. At this time, only the following actions are permissible:
    - Increase the credit line by collateralizing more $NECTAR
    - Reduce debt position by burning $HONEY

#### Undercollateralized loan without credit worthiness
Instead of determining one’s credit worthiness with credit scoring which is _exclusive_ in nature, an individual’s ability to borrow in excess of his collateral is a result of:
1) __Ownership of Credit__: Psychological ownership can lead to positive behavior such as experienced responsibility and stewardship where debt holders will act responsibly in managing their debt level.
2) __Risk Management__: The threat of liquidation and loss of $NECTAR will deter risky borrowing 
3) __Community Growth__: The key that gels everything together is the growth of the community which pushes $NECTAR’s value up making every participant better off. This will incentivize each stakeholder to act in the best interest to maintain its stability and integrity.
The psychology of ownership, effective risk management and community growth will enable under collateralization in a world of uncertainty.

### Monetizing
Traditionally, lenders with excess capital and in search of yield will purchase bonds or use P2P lending
platforms for higher yield. However the strategies have unfavorable risk to reward as they expose lenders to maximum downside with minimum upside.

As mentioned, lenders want to minimize as much of the risk yet achieve the highest yield possible. Honeycomb introduces an alternative way to earn a yield where $NECTAR holders can monetize their credit together with $COMB by becoming a liquidity provider. In exchange they earn protocol revenues in exchange for contributing to the stability of the protocol.

Since yield farmers don’t play the role as a lender, they enjoy a better value proposition which satisfy their risk preferences where:
- They are not exposed to default risk
- They enjoy credit appreciation through community growth - unlimited upside
- Daily accrued yield from protocol revenue and their deposits.

### Tokenomics
#### $COMB Token Use-Case
- __Payments__: $COMB is used as a form of protocol currency to make payment for Honeycomb services such as minting, withdrawal and conversion.
- __$NECTAR liquidity__:  Liquidity providers lock their $NECTAR and $COMB in the Credit Swap liquidity pool.  In return, they will receive a share of revenue generated from fees. 
- __$HONEY Stability__: $COMB is used to maintain the stability of $HONEY by providing arbitrageurs with risk-free profit through the conversion of $COMB and $HONEY. 
- __Rewards/Incentives__: Users will be rewarded with $COMB as a form of incentive that will positively benefit the Honeycomb ecosystem.

#### Token Allocation
In the interest of transparency and full disclosure, 1,000,000,000 $COMB will be minted at genesis and allocated as follows. 

- __65% to Honeycomb protocol community__:  A maximum of 550,000,000 $COMB will be allocated for liquidity programs, staking contracts and protocol stability.   
- __15% to Team, Advisors and contributing partners__: 250,000,000 $COMB will be allocated to current (and future) Honeycomb employees and advisors.  
- __20% to Investors__: 300,000,000 $COMB will be allocated to early investors of Honeycomb, to thank them for believing in the dream, supporting the vision and providing the runway necessary for us to succeed in the long run.
