#### 2.3 Value Proposition
##### 1. Capital Efficient
**Under Collateralization**  
The Honeycomb ecosystem is built on the concept of a bonding curve and token incentives, enabling users to acquire loans at a value that is larger than their existing collateral. This is in contrast to other dominant DeFi players which require borrowers to have significantly over-collateralized positions, which we deem to be highly capital inefficient. In essence, Honeycomb provides leverage in the form of _under-collateralized loans_, which allows users to be _efficient_ and _effective_ in their use of capital.

**Zero Interest**  
As counterparty is removed, interest rates traditionally associated with the cost of borrowing are eliminated. Honeycomb users can borrow money without paying any interest, which they most definitely would have incurred in TradFi borrowing.

**No Fixed Repayment Date**  
The removal of the counterparty also eliminates the need for fixed or periodic loan repayments. Borrowers are no longer obligated to pay back their loans within a rigid time frame, which may be disruptive to the operation of their businesses, personal finance or investment. Instead, users are simply incentivized to prudently manage their debt ratio.

##### 2. Frictionless
**No Need For Documentation**  
DeFi does not require any form of legal documentation to access financial services. This means no KYC is required to open an account. More importantly, the practice of credit scoring to access loans –  deemed necessary as a form of risk mitigation in TradFi –  will be unquestionably made redundant.

**Instant Liquidity**  
Acquiring loans is a time-consuming process in TradFi. In contrast, Honeycomb users receive _instant_ on-chain liquidity as the protocol operates through the use of encrypted distributed ledgers that provide real-time verification of transactions, without the need for intermediaries such as correspondent banks and clearing houses. 

**Low Fee**  
In contrast to the high operating costs (e.g. brick and mortar banks, back offices, databases, compliance handling etc.) associated with TradFi, DeFi has _low operating costs_ by nature. This is because DeFi runs on the public blockchain which covers most of the backend infrastructure cost. The result is lower costs of operating which we translate directly to our users.

In summary, DeFi reduces friction and lowers the barrier to entry for financial services. Anyone can use the Honeycomb Protocol to access instant capital anytime, anywhere as long as they have an internet connection, a mobile phone or computer. 

##### 3. Attractive Yields
**Staking Rewards**  
Honeycomb users searching for high yields can _monetize_ their credit by staking their credit which will earn them a portion of the protocol’s revenue. This is a reward for contributing to the stability of the protocol. Moreover, users will also enjoy credit growth as the community grows. 

##### 3. Transparent & Governance-Free
**No Governance Mechanism**  
Decentralized governance protocols that give token holders the right to vote on protocol changes and economic parameters have proven to be ineffective due to low participation rates and incentive misalignment. This is because power is allocated to users according to the number of tokens they hold, meaning that users with a larger number of tokens will hold more power. At the same time, each voter has different biases, motivations and opinions on what is best. This has caused some protocols to produce suboptimal outcomes, where some users have maliciously attempted to benefit themselves at the expense of others [^5]. At this point in time [^6], Honeycomb has taken a stance not to implement any governance mechanism so that we can remain highly efficient as a protocol. 

**Immutable Parameters**  
Accordingly, Honeycomb does not rely on any governance mechanism to vote on monetary intervention. All protocol parameters are pre-set and immutable, and fees follow an algorithm controlled by the protocol. This means that the protocol is clearly defined and will not be subject to any external human intervention, making each interaction deterministic and predictable, where users will know exactly what to expect.
