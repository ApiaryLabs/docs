# Honeycomb White Paper V1


### 1. Abstract 
Honeycomb protocol is the first _community-driven_, decentralized credit protocol that seeks to redefine the traditional [fractional banking system](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fractionalreservebanking.asp) and _democratize credit_. The democratization of credit is achieved through the use of blockchain technology, which employs algorithmic smart contracts, eliminating the need for trust. Honeycomb also introduces a stable digital currency designed to complement both fiat and cryptocurrencies as a means to transact and store value. At Honeycomb, we are guided by the belief that credit should be transparent, accessible, and inclusive. 

In traditional finance (TradFi), banks create [_credit money_](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-money.asp) by lending deposits out and profiting from it. Honeycomb Protocol adopts a radically different approach, instead taking in deposits as a reserve. In turn, credit is created following an algorithm programmed into an on-chain credit facility. As a result, users attain _true credit_[^1] and _ownership_ and ultimately the freedom to borrow, earn or swap as they desire. 

Other DeFi borrowing and lending protocols do indeed exist on the blockchain, but Honeycomb Protocol differentiates itself from the status quo by providing under-collateralized loans with zero interest and no fixed repayment date. Additionally, an unprecedented credit swap facility is introduced to give Honeycomb users the ability to earn a portion of the protocol’s revenue, or to trade credit so as to realize its future value.

[^1]: True Credit is defined as the amount of money an individual can  access and its value is greater than its collateral.

### 2. Introduction
#### 2.1 The Problem

Alongside vast improvements in technology in the last decade, the financial services industry has experienced significant digital advancements. Innovations in the financial sector have however failed to make a significant impact on the lives of the marginalized, for whom access to capital is still a distant illusion. In particular, women, young adults and people living in poverty are disproportionately underserved [^2]. 

It is known in TradFi that the process of attaining credit utilizes archaic methods such as credit scoring to decide a borrower’s riskiness. In addition, credit processes are excessively complex, resulting in a lengthy process with unnecessary high fees. This means that it is uneconomical to provide small loans. Moreover, the decision-making process is opaque and unpredictable. Oftentimes, rules are dictated by those in control, creating a misalignment of incentives between institutions and their participants.

As a result, TradFi has historically excluded a majority of individuals – those not considered wealthy and those who never had the opportunity to accumulate a proper credit history. More than 1.7 billion people today are unable to receive financial services from traditional institutions in any capacity [^2].

While various Fintech companies have improved access to financial services and tout their own advantages, many of them are still heavily verticalized [^3] and have carried forward inefficient processes from TradFi. For example, many peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms still rely on credit scores to approve loans. This is a significant obstacle for those who do not live in countries equipped with proper informational financial infrastructures. Furthermore, P2P lending is considered an unsecured loan, exposing borrowers to higher interest rates so as to compensate lenders for the risk.

Built on the blockchain and utilizing smart contracts, Decentralised Finance (DeFi) was introduced to reinvent TradFi services. In DeFi, financial transactions are powered by smart contracts, eliminating intermediaries, thereby reducing the cost and friction experienced in TradFi. DeFi opens up a myriad of financial possibilities for those who have been traditionally outcast by TradFi, while remaining open to those who live in countries with strong financial infrastructure and who already have access to financial products. 

In the current DeFi lending model, access to capital demands over-collateralization, which is deemed both necessary to overcome extreme volatility and as an incentive to repay the loan. This status quo is _capital inefficient_ and _costly_ as it prevents wider adoption and can only target a small market that requires lenders who also want to borrow. To add on, its model is _financially exclusive_ as it falsely assumes that capital is easily available to everyone. Therefore, DeFi growth has stagnated with its frictions and limited use cases creating a gap with TradFi.

To overcome these barriers, new DeFi protocols have come up with innovative solutions to offer under-collateralized loans. Such examples include flash loans, leveraged yield farming, leveraged trading and NFT collateral. However, these approaches still exclude those who have been traditionally underbanked.  Flash loans, leveraged yield farming, leveraged trading are catered towards the speculative market, while NFT collateral requires owning a highly speculative and illiquid asset which the financially marginalized do not have access to. In essence, DeFi’s over-collateralization model does not advance financial inclusion for those who need it the most.

More can be done in this space to improve financial inclusion while bridging the gap between TradFi to improve wider adoption.

#### 2.2 The Solution

Honeycomb Protocol addresses the above-mentioned shortcomings by leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts to create _credit money_ and a decentralized stable coin which is used as a medium of exchange. With [_Web 3.0_](https://www.investopedia.com/web-20-web-30-5208698), Honeycomb is able to re-define and democratize how _credit money_ is created and managed. 

Unlike how traditional banks create _credit money_ that they ultimately own, Honeycomb gives credit _ownership_ to users of the protocol. This means that each user of the protocol has full control of their credit, which gives them the autonomy to manage however they like or _monetize_ it. Users have the option to stake and earn protocol fees, or to swap their credit in an exchange, or to borrow against their credit. Our team at Apiary Labs[^4] hopes to _empower_ society, so that anyone anywhere can freely access capital without being inhibited by elements outside of their control.

#### 2.3 Value Proposition
##### 1. Capital Efficient
**Under Collateralization**  
The Honeycomb ecosystem is built on the concept of a bonding curve and token incentives, enabling users to acquire loans at a value that is larger than their existing collateral. This is in contrast to other dominant DeFi players which require borrowers to have significantly over-collateralized positions, which we deem to be highly capital inefficient. In essence, Honeycomb provides leverage in the form of _under-collateralized loans_, which allows users to be _efficient_ and _effective_ in their use of capital.

**Zero Interest**  
As counterparty is removed, interest rates traditionally associated with the cost of borrowing are eliminated. Honeycomb users can borrow money without paying any interest, which they most definitely would have incurred in TradFi borrowing.

**No Fixed Repayment Date**  
The removal of the counterparty also eliminates the need for fixed or periodic loan repayments. Borrowers are no longer obligated to pay back their loans within a rigid time frame, which may be disruptive to the operation of their businesses, personal finance or investment. Instead, users are simply incentivized to prudently manage their debt ratio.

##### 2. Frictionless
**No Need For Documentation**  
DeFi does not require any form of legal documentation to access financial services. This means no KYC is required to open an account. More importantly, the practice of credit scoring to access loans –  deemed necessary as a form of risk mitigation in TradFi –  will be unquestionably made redundant.

**Instant Liquidity**  
Acquiring loans is a time-consuming process in TradFi. In contrast, Honeycomb users receive _instant_ on-chain liquidity as the protocol operates through the use of encrypted distributed ledgers that provide real-time verification of transactions, without the need for intermediaries such as correspondent banks and clearing houses. 

**Low Fee**  
In contrast to the high operating costs (e.g. brick and mortar banks, back offices, databases, compliance handling etc.) associated with TradFi, DeFi has _low operating costs_ by nature. This is because DeFi runs on the public blockchain which covers most of the backend infrastructure cost. The result is lower costs of operating which we translate directly to our users.

In summary, DeFi reduces friction and lowers the barrier to entry for financial services. Anyone can use the Honeycomb Protocol to access instant capital anytime, anywhere as long as they have an internet connection, a mobile phone or computer. 

##### 3. Attractive Yields
**Staking Rewards**  
Honeycomb users searching for high yields can _monetize_ their credit by staking their credit which will earn them a portion of the protocol’s revenue. This is a reward for contributing to the stability of the protocol. Moreover, users will also enjoy credit growth as the community grows. 

##### 3. Transparent & Governance-Free
**No Governance Mechanism**  
Decentralized governance protocols that give token holders the right to vote on protocol changes and economic parameters have proven to be ineffective due to low participation rates and incentive misalignment. This is because power is allocated to users according to the number of tokens they hold, meaning that users with a larger number of tokens will hold more power. At the same time, each voter has different biases, motivations and opinions on what is best. This has caused some protocols to produce suboptimal outcomes, where some users have maliciously attempted to benefit themselves at the expense of others [^5]. At this point in time [^6], Honeycomb has taken a stance not to implement any governance mechanism so that we can remain highly efficient as a protocol. 

**Immutable Parameters**  
Accordingly, Honeycomb does not rely on any governance mechanism to vote on monetary intervention. All protocol parameters are pre-set and immutable, and fees follow an algorithm controlled by the protocol. This means that the protocol is clearly defined and will not be subject to any external human intervention, making each interaction deterministic and predictable, where users will know exactly what to expect.

</p>

#### 3.1 Honeycomb Four Token Model
Honeycomb uses a four token model – Reserve Currency, **$NECTAR**, **$HONEY** and **$COMB** Token – to facilitate interaction within its ecosystem. This creates _decentralized credit_ and liquidity. The four tokens and their uses are described as follows:

1. The **Reserve Currency** is a non-stable cryptocurrency that acts as the base money in the _Credit Facility_. It will be used as a reserve to back-up and give value to $NECTAR. 
2. **$NECTAR** is the core of the Honeycomb Protocol, which represents _Credit_ in the ecosystem. It is a continuous token derived from the bonding curve, whose value is deterministic and an increasing function of the reserve currency. Honeycomb users can collateralize $NECTAR and obtain liquidity in the form of $HONEY. 
3. **$HONEY** is the Honeycomb Protocol’s stable digital currency pegged to the US Dollar. It is minted against $NECTAR as a form of _Debt_ to be utilized based on the needs of the user. $HONEY is trust-lessly redeemable for the $COMB. 
4. **$COMB** is the protocol’s utility token that serves to capture fees and provide economic incentives. It is used to stabilize $HONEY’s dollar value through liquidity conversion. All $COMB tokens will be minted at genesis for gradual distribution.

#### 3.2 Honeycomb Stakeholders
1. **Borrowers** collateralize their $NECTAR to mint $HONEY based on a credit line.
2. **Liquidity Providers** lock pair tokens – $NECTAR and $COMB –  to the Credit Swap Facility in exchange for earning a portion of the protocol’s revenue.
3. **Traders** will swap $NECTAR or $COMB tokens interchangeably based on the individual’s utility, so as to take advantage of price differentials, improve their credit line or to reduce their credit holdings.
4. **Arbitrageurs** will take advantage of the deviation in prices between $HONEY and the US Dollar by swapping $COMB or $HONEY in the liquidy converter to make a risk free profit.

#### 3.3 How Does It Works?
Honeycomb Protocol is a fully automated, on-chain credit protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain [^7]. Like existing DeFi lending protocols, borrowers are required to collateralize in order to mint stablecoins in the form of debt. Unlike existing lending protocols however, Honeycomb is capital-efficient as it does not require over-collateralization, giving its users “_True Credit_” to borrow more than their initial collateral.

In order to join the Honeycomb ecosystem, participants must first deposit their reserve currency that will be used as base money to generate Credit via the Credit Facility. The value of credit follows a deterministic algorithm that grows as base money increases. $NECTAR holders have the option to either borrow against their credit in the Liquidity Facility or become a liquidity provider by locking their $NECTAR along with their $COMB in the Credit Swap Facility to earn a portion of the protocol’s revenue. Apart from borrowing and earning, Honeycomb users can swap $NECTAR with $COMB and vice versa to realize its future value ahead of time. Arbitrageurs can make a risk-free profit while also playing a role in maintaining the stability of $HONEY by converting between $COMB and $HONEY in the Liquidity Converter to adjust the supply in the secondary market. These four facilities work hand in hand to ensure the protocol functions as it should.

### 4. System Overview
#### 4.1 Credit Facility
The _Credit Facility_ allows users to access credit anytime, anywhere in a permissionless manner, in the form of $NECTAR. Upon depositing the approved reserve currency, the user receives an amount of $NECTAR as determined by Honeycomb’s _Credit Facility Smart Contract_. The deterministic algorithm within the smart contract is integral to the system, as it removes the need for human intervention, while reliably creating credit for its users. The combined reserve currency stored in the smart contract acts as the base money which will be used to determine the amount of _credit_ in circulation.  As Honeycomb welcomes more users, the value of $NECTAR will increase, increasing the total _credit money_ in circulation.

The Credit Facility Smart Contract is a continuous token model with a built-in liquidity mechanism that uses the concept of a bonding curve to create credit. $NECTAR can be minted or burned anytime by depositing or withdrawing the reserve currency to and from the smart contract. $NECTAR value appreciation is governed by the fixed reserve ratio, _r_.

###### Price of Nectar
$$
P = \frac{R}{Q_N\times r}
$$
As each subsequent reserve currency is deposited, it increases the supply of $NECTAR. The price of $NECTAR then continuously recalibrates so that the reserve ratio remains constant. The ratio selected determines the price sensitivity, which directly correlates to the amount of _credit money_ in circulation. 

###### Reserve Ratio
$$
r = \frac{R}{P\times Q_N}
$$
The reserve ratio is a fixed ratio between the $$ Q_N × P $$ and the total reserve currency locked in the smart contract, _R_. This ratio will be determined by the Honeycomb founding team, and takes on a range from $$0≤r≤1$$ which will always be held constant.

</p>


Scenario 1, $$r=1$$:  
When $$r=1$$, $NECTAR’s price remains constant and is independent of its supply. This implies that its value is pegged to the reserve currency. In other words, credit money is not created while $NECTAR becomes a proxy for the reserve currency. This can be likened to the gold standard, where the currency value is pegged to gold and can be exchanged for a fixed amount of gold.

</p>


Scenario 2, $$r<1$$:  
When $$r<1$$, $NECTAR’s price increases relative to an increase in reserve currency, resulting in credit money being created. This is similar to the current fractional reserve banking system we see today, where a fraction of the money in circulation is backed by actual cash on hand. The amount of excess credit created relative to the reserve currency is dependent on the reserve ratio. When $$r=0.5$$, $NECTAR’s price increases linearly with its supply, while $NECTAR’s price increases exponentially when $$r<0.5$$ and diminishes when $$r>0.5$$, as can be seen in the table above. 

##### 4.1.1 Minting $NECTAR
$$
q_n = Q_N(\frac{D_n}{R}+1)^r-1
$$
Anyone can acquire $NECTAR in exchange for depositing reserve currency, $$D_n$$. The amount of $NECTAR, qn received follows the algorithm above where the quantity received is determined based on the total supply of $NECTAR in circulation, $$Q_N$$ and the total reserve currency, $$R$$. The quantity of $NECTAR minted is reduced for each subsequent mint, as the amount of reserve tokens increases. Simply put, each subsequent $NECTAR minted becomes more “expensive”, and as such less $NECTAR is received for the same amount of reserve currency.

##### 4.1.2 Value of $NECTAR
$$
NV_n = Price_{NV} \times Quantity_{NV}
$$
Where:
$$
NV_n=-r.P.Q_N\times ((\frac{q_n}{Q_N}+1)^\frac{1}{r} -1)\times P_{reserveToken,30ma}
$$
The value of $NECTAR, $$NV_n$$ represents the value of $NECTAR each Honeycomb user holds. Its value does not follow the conventional bonding curve value, $$P\times q_n$$, as its immediate inflation may lead to undesirable behaviour, causing instability to the protocol. Instead, the value of $NECTAR is derived from the integral of the price function as seen below. This formula behaves so that the value of every newly minted $NECTAR approximately[^8] equals the reserve currency value at initiation. This way, it does not give bad agents the  incentive to cash out for immediate profit.The formula can be further broken down as such: 

$$
Quantity_{NV}=-r.Q_N\times ((\frac{q_n}{Q_N}+1)^\frac{1}{r} -1)
$$
The quantity component follows a concave relationship where $$Quantity_NV$$ experiences diminishing returns for every increase in $NECTAR the user holds. The unique concave property introduces unique implications in the Credit Swap Facility and will be further explained in section (4.3.2) below.

$$
Price_{NV}=P \times P_{reserveToken,30ma}
$$

The price component is derived by multiplying the price of the reserve currency, $$P_{reserveToken,30MA} with $NECTAR’s price, $P$, which follows a deterministic price movement. Given that the reserve currency is a non-stable coin, it will be exposed to price volatility observed in the crypto market. To circumvent this, the 30-day moving average price is used, so as to hedge against price volatilities that may result in unfavourable outcomes for Honeycomb stakeholders.


##### 4.1.3 Credit Money
Credit money is defined as the creation of monetary value in the financial system. In the current financial system, credit money is introduced through the fractional reserve banking system where commercial banks issue loans greater than the deposit they hold. The amount of credit money created depends on the reserves set by the Federal Reserve. Likewise, credit money is also determined by a reserve ratio, $$0≤r≤1$$.  However, credit money at Honeycomb Protocol is created through an algorithm rather than future claims.

As mentioned previously, the reserve ratio is decided by the Honeycomb founding team, and the value chosen has an impact on the amount of credit money created. A higher value of r results in less credit money created, while a lower value of r means more credit money is created. The chart below shows how much credit money is created based on the different reserve ratios. It can be interpreted as follows: On average, the amount of monetary value created is $$x$$ for every dollar of reserve.

<p align="middle">
    <img width="600" alt="Credit Money" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102786818/163556896-5b479681-366b-43f9-952a-dd7d1bf71f8f.png"/>
</p>

[^8]: It is approximate and not equal to the reserve currency value due to the use of the 30 day moving average. If the reserve currency is a stablecoin, the floor value will be equal to the reserve currency deposited.

##### 4.1.4 Exiting Honeycomb
Users of the protocol may choose to exit the protocol for any number of reasons. To do so, they may want to exchange their $NECTAR for the reserve currency, or $COMB that can be easily traded outside of the protocol. In such an event, the user has two options to choose from:
1. Withdraw their initial amount of reserve currency.
2. Choose to swap their $NECTAR for $COMB token via the Credit Swap Facility; refer to Section 4.3.1

Option 2 would be a dominant strategy in most cases as users are able to exchange their $COMB for a value that is more than their initial deposit, especially if their $NECTAR has appreciated in value. Since the value of $NECTAR uses the 30-day moving average price, there exists a possibility that $$reservCurrency_n>NV_n$$. In such a situation, some users may choose option 1 and withdraw their reserve currency as the payoff from doing so is higher at that point in time.

###### Withdrawal Fee
Withdrawal of the reserve currency imposes negative externalities on other Honeycomb users as it necessarily reduces the value of each user’s $NECTAR. To disincentivize consecutive redemptions, a withdrawal fee is introduced, with an algorithm that works to make each subsequent withdrawal of the reserve currency more expensive. The algorithm also deters “whales” from redeeming a majority of their $NECTAR at one time, as the amount of fees paid increases with the amount of $NECTAR redeemed.
$$
withdrawal fee = f + B(t)
$$

Similar to Liquity’s fee structure, Honeycomb’s withdrawal fee follows the formula above and is a function of the base rate, $$B(t)$$ and the fixed redemption fee, $$f$$ of $$1%$$. The fee is subtracted from the redeemed reserve currency, reducing the amount of reserve currency the user receives in return.

$$
B(t) = B(t - 1)_{\delta} + \alpha \times \frac{redeem_n}{Q_N}
$$

The base rate is a function of the previous base rate, $$B(t - 1)_{\delta}$$ and the redeemed quantity of $NECTAR relative to the total quantity of $NECTAR in circulation. During a redemption, the base rate is increased by the proportion of withdrawn $NECTAR and added to the previous base rate. At launch, the base rate is _initialized_ at 0.

$$
Decay Function: B(T-1)_{\delta} = B(T-1)\times \delta^{\Delta t}
$$

The previous base rate, $$B(t)$$ decays over time due to a decay factor, $$\delta^{\Delta t}$$ that is applied with every withdrawal prior to calculating the resulting fee. The magnitude of decay depends on the time that has elapsed, $$\Delta t$$ since the last redemption and $$\delta$$ is selected such that the base rate tapers to 50% after 12 hours. 

#### 4.2 Liquidity Facility
The _Liquidity Facility_ follows an over-collateralized model[^9] we see in the current DeFi ecosystem where decentralised stable coins are minted. It is integral to the ecosystem as it provides users with easy access to liquidity in the form of a stable coin, done in a trust-less manner. Trust is achieved through the transparency of the blockchain, effective management of risk and an incentive structure that ensures stability of the protocol and $HONEY.

Honeycomb users can realize their credit anytime through the liquidity facility by collateralizing their $NECTAR and paying a variable mint fee in the form of $COMB. In exchange, the user receives $HONEY, the value of which is pegged to the USD.

As $HONEY is minted against $NECTAR, Honeycomb defines $HONEY as debt owed to the protocol. Hence, the minting of $HONEY is recorded as debt. At all times, the user’s debt cannot exceed their [credit line](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lineofcredit.asp), else they will risk losing their collateralized $NECTAR. Risk-averse users are encouraged to mint $HONEY based on their needs, so as to hedge against the loss of their $NECTAR. In order to retrieve their $NECTAR, the debt position must be closed off by burning $HONEY through the Credit Facility Smart Contract.


[^9]: Note that $HONEY is under-collateralized in terms of the reserve currency. However, the underlying strategy is over-collateralized through $NECTAR
[^10]: Note that $$NVn≥creditLine_n$$, which implies a margin of safety to account for volatility in the value of $NECTAR.

##### 4.2.1 Minting of $HONEY
To mint $HONEY, users will lock their $NECTAR into the _Liquidity Facility Smart Contract_. The amount of $HONEY users are allowed to mint is based on the user’s credit line. A user’s credit line[^10] is calculated as a function of his deposit and a multiplier as seen below. The multiplier follows a tiered level system that is based on the credit-to-deposit ratio, $$\frac{NV_n}{D_n}$$.

$$
creditLine_n = M_n \times D_n
$$


| Tier | Multiplier |
| - | :-: |
| 0 | $$ M_n = \begin{cases} \frac{NV_n}{D_n},& where& \frac{NV_n}{D_n}<1 \end {cases} $$
| 1 | $$ M_n= \begin{cases} 1,& 1≤\frac{NV_n}{D_n} <1.1\\ 1.1,& 1.1≤\frac{NV_n}{D_n} <1.2\\ 1.2,& 1.2≤\frac{NV_n}{D_n} <1.3\\ 1.3,& 1.3≤\frac{NV_n}{D_n} <1.4\\ 1.4,& 1.4≤\frac{NV_n}{D_n} <1.5\\ 1.5,& 1.5≤\frac{NV_n}{D_n} <1.6\\ 1.6,& 1.6≤\frac{NV_n}{D_n} <1.7\\ 1.7,& 1.7≤\frac{NV_n}{D_n} <1.8\\ 1.8,& 1.8≤\frac{NV_n}{D_n} <1.9\\ 1.9,& 1.9≤\frac{NV_n}{D_n} <2 \end {cases} $$ |
| 2| $$ M_n= \begin{cases} 2,& 2≤\frac{NV_n}{D_n} <2.2\\ 2.2,& 2.2≤\frac{NV_n}{D_n} <2.4\\ 2.4,& 2.4≤\frac{NV_n}{D_n} <2.6\\ 2.6,& 2.6≤\frac{NV_n}{D_n} <2.8\\ 2.8,& 2.8≤\frac{NV_n}{D_n} <3\\ \end{cases} $$
| 3 | $$ M_n= \begin{cases} 3,& 3≤\frac{NV_n}{D_n} <3.25\\ 3.25,& 3.25≤\frac{NV_n}{D_n} <3.5\\ 3.5,& 3.5≤\frac{NV_n}{D_n} <3.75\\ 3.75,& 3.75≤\frac{NV_n}{D_n} <4\\ \end{cases} $$
| 4 | $$ M_n= \begin{cases} 4,& 4≤\frac{NV_n}{D_n} <4.5\\ 4.5,& 4.5≤\frac{NV_n}{D_n} <5\\ \end{cases} $$
| 5| $$ M_n= \begin{cases}  5,& where& 5<\frac{NV_n}{D_n} \end {cases} $$ 



##### 4.2.2 Minting of $HONEY
Minting fee is introduced as a form of “monetary policy” to govern the supply of $HONEY in circulation. It is also implemented as a form of friction to deter Honeycomb users from minting out more $HONEY than they should, which will lead to instability in the liquidity facility. The fee is designed such that it increases as debt increases and only those with a higher willingness to pay will mint out more $HONEY. The minting fee follows the formula below.

$$
Mint Fee = \frac{(Debt_{n,t-1}+Debt_{n,t})^{\alpha}}{Threshold_n} + \frac{Debt_N^{\beta}}{R} \times peg
$$

where:

$$
Threshold_n = (1 - r + \frac{D_n}{P\times q_n}) \times r.P.q_n
$$

The minting fee is a function of the individual’s debt accrued, the overall debt in the system and the peg between $HONEY and the US dollar. $$Threshold_n$$ is an algorithmic driven variable that determines when the minting fee starts to scale, such that the sum of each user’s threshold equals the to reserve currency $$\alpha$$ and $$\beta$$ represents the sensitivity parameter of each component. The peg is a parameter that either decreases or increases the mint fee based on the market forces of $HONEY, so as to encourage or discourage users from introducing more supply into the market. More on that in section 4.2.3 under _Monetary Policy_.


##### 4.2.3 $HONEY Stability
The primary objective of a currency is to maintain its _stability_ so as to retain its purchasing power and to be adopted as a medium of exchange. This is achieved through trust in the system, where arbitrageurs can bring prices back to the peg by buying at a lower price and reliably redeeming for a profit if the peg breaks from the secondary market. However, if the trust in the redemption process breaks down, arbitrageurs may not participate, thereby causing the peg to break. Divergence from the peg is minimized through the stabilization mechanism and monetary interventions.

###### Stability Mechanism
For $HONEY to maintain its peg to the dollar, the liquidity facility must be sufficiently collateralized with $NECTAR such that borrowers are always incentivized to close their debt position, in an environment where creditworthiness is unknown. At the same time, the price volatility of the reserve currency needs to be taken into consideration. To overcome this volatility, three levels of stability measures are put in place to ensure $HONEY maintains its peg. The three levels are:
1. Margin Call  
 Margin call is the first line of defense and is triggered when the debt level of a user surpasses 90% of the credit line. The margin call notifies the user to reduce their debt level or improve their creditline by locking up more $NECTAR. 

2. Redistribution Mechanism  
$$
distribution Parameter_n = \frac{creditLine_n - Debt_n}{\sum{creditLine_n-Debt_n}}
$$

 <img width="450" alt="After" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102786818/163706859-e3eb3558-ca44-4236-80d2-0c3ddd68d7f7.png">    
</p>


 Redistribution is triggered when the borrower’s $$Debt_n>creditLine_n$$. The smart contract will automatically close off the borrower’s debt position by redistributing the debt position to other existing debt holders based on the distribution parameter above. Concurrently, other debt holders will inherit the liquidated $NECTAR pro-rata as a compensation for taking on more debt, and they will experience a net positive benefit as the $$NV_n>creditLine_n$$.

 To prevent cascading liquidation, the distribution parameter prioritizes users with a healthier Debt-to-Credit ratio. Debt holders with a healthier Debt-to-Credit ratio will be better off as they will receive more $NECTAR tokens, giving users an incentive to maintain a healthy debt level. Similarly, the threat of liquidation and loss of potential appreciation of $NECTAR’s value incentivizes risky borrowers to improve their Debt-to-Credit ratio.

3. Circuit Breaker
 $$
 TCDR_N=\frac{\sum{creditLine_n}}{Debt_N}
 $$  
 Where: $$TDCR_N$$ represents the total credit to debt rato  
 
 To keep the total amount of $HONEY in circulation sufficiently collateralized[^11] in a time of crisis, the protocol incorporates a Circuit Breaker that prevents the Liquidity Facility’s health from falling below the critical threshold, TCDR<1. When Circuit Breaker is in force, all operations that would worsen the $$TCDR_N$$[^12] will be temporarily disabled. In this time, only the following actions are permissible:

 - Increase the credit line by collateralizing more $NECTAR
 - Reduce debt position by burning $HONEY

 This allows the system to activate Circuit Breaker at an earlier time, which is a safety precaution to ensure sufficient collateralization.

Should the execution of a particular level be unsuccessful, the next level will be triggered.


[^11]: In terms of $NECTAR value
[^12]: It is important to note that $$TCDR_N$$ incorporates the actual price of the reserve currency instead of the 30-day moving average, as the price of the $$reserveCurrency<reserveCurrency_30MA$$ during a bear market.

###### Monetary Intervention
Price of $HONEY in the secondary market may fluctuate due to market forces. In order to return $HONEY’s price back to its peg, the supply of $HONEY must be adjusted to meet liquidity demands, where:
- All else equal, an increase in economic activity will result in higher demand for $HONEY, pushing its price above the peg. By sufficiently increasing the supply of $HONEY, the price will return back to its peg.
- All else equal, a decrease in economic activity will result in lower demand for $HONEY, pushing its price below the peg. By sufficiently decreasing the supply of $HONEY, the price will return back to its peg.

###### Liquidity Converter
Similar to Terra, the Liquidity Converter smart contract’s willingness to respect the target exchange rate irrespective of market conditions keeps $HONEY closely pegged to the USD. An arbitrageur is able to achieve a risk-free profit when $HONEY deviates from its 1-dollar peg, while maintaining the stability of $HONEY. 
$COMB serves as the first line of defense against the price fluctuations of $HONEY through a Liquidity Converter. When:
- $HONEY < 1 USD, arbitrageurs can send 1 $HONEY to the Liquidity Converter and receive 1 USD worth of $COMB.
- $HONEY > 1 USD, arbitrageurs can send 1 $COMB to the Liquidity Converter and receive 1 $HONEY.

Intuitively, this is analogous to a form of monetary policy otherwise known as quantitative easing, where central banks buy and sell short-term bonds on the open market to add more liquidity into the banking system until interest rate targets are met.

###### Monetary Policy
The minting fee acts as a second line of defense, where the minting fee adjusts and scales relative to price deviation from the peg, to encourage or discourage the creation of newly minted $HONEY as mentioned above. When:
- $HONEY < 1 USD, it implies a contraction in economic activity.  The minting fee becomes more expensive disincentivizing the minting of $HONEY, bringing the $HONEY back to equilibrium.
- $HONEY > 1 USD, it implies an expansion in economic activity. The minting fee becomes cheaper, incentivizing the minting of $HONEY, bringing the $HONEY back to equilibrium.
This can be likened to the Federal Reserve adjusting interest rates, thereby making borrowing more or less expensive, so as to slow or stimulate the growth of an economy.



#### 4.3 Credit Swap Facility
Like all DEXes in the market, the _Credit Swap Facility_  is an automated market maker that uses a constant product curve to determine the exchange rate between $HONEY and $COMB. The Credit Swap Facility is integral to Honeycomb’s ecosystem as it provides continuous liquidity and price discovery for $HONEY. This provides borrowers with the incentive to close their debt position, as they are able to swap their $NECTAR for a value that is higher than their debt, providing stability. At the same time, it allows users to realize the value of their $NECTAR by selling it.

##### 4.3.1 Credit Swap
In TradFi, the concept of credit trading is unheard of, as credit is created through the fractional reserve banking system and controlled by a central entity such as banks that own and manage credit to be lent out. This means that all the profits made from the creation of credit goes to the banks. With web 3.0, the reliance on “trust-based institution” has been made redundant and this has opened up many new possibilities in the realm of financial services. At Honeycomb, we are reengineering the creation of credit, making credit ownership possible, and credit trading a reality. With Honeycomb, users can manage their credit by increasing or decreasing their $NECTAR holdings through the _Credit Swap Facility_, or arbitrage to make risk-free profits. 

##### 4.3.2 Redistribution of Wealth
Due to the concave nature of the value of $NECTAR, each user will value their $NECTAR differently, where:
- Users with larger holdings will value their $NECTAR at a lower price relative to another user with a smaller holding. A lower valuation implies a higher propensity to swap $NECTAR for $COMB (_sell_) in the _Credit Swap Facility_.
- Likewise, users with smaller holdings will value each individual $NECTAR at a higher price relative to another user with a larger holding. A higher valuation implies a higher propensity to swap $COMB for $NECTAR (_buy_) in the Credit Swap Facility.
This difference in valuation will omit tail-end users on either side of the market, allowing transfer of $NECTAR between users with larger and smaller $NECTAR holdings, creating a more equitable outcome in the long-run while benefiting everyone in the process.

##### 4.3.3 Liquidity Providers
Liquidity providers are an essential part of Honeycomb’s ecosystem as they provide positive externalities to the community. By locking up both $NECTAR and $COMB, the following is achieved: 
- Reduction of price slippage during an exchange. 
Creation of scarcity of $COMB in the secondary market, thereby producing an upward price pressure which benefits long term holders of $COMB.
Creation of stability in the Liquidity Facility, as the propensity for redemption through the Credit Facility is reduced.

$NECTAR holders with excess credit can choose to be Liquidity Providers to earn a yield. In exchange they will receive LP tokens that:
- Give them rights to a portion of the protocol revenue as a form of reward and incentive to stake their tokens.
- Tracks the relative proportion of the total reserve that each liquidity provider has contributed to the pool. They can be returned anytime to redeem a proportional share of the liquidity for the provider.


### 5. Honeycomb Tokenomics
$COMB is an integral part of the Honeycomb ecosystem. The token is used to organically grow the protocol, with a participatory business model where investors = users. Economic incentives are provided for users to act in the best interest of the protocol, and users can earn $COMB as a form of economic reward. 

For instance, $COMB and $NECTAR holders can stake in the _Credit Swap's_ liquidity pool to provide liquidity, and as a reward for doing so, receive a share of profits. Additionally, a Liquidity Provider must also obtain $NECTAR, which puts an upward pressure on credit, improving the overall Debt-to-Credit health. Fees become cheaper, which encourages more people to take on more debt, thereby increasing protocol revenues. Some of this increased revenue which will go towards treasury spending aimed at continuously improving the protocol. This is Honeycomb’s flywheel – one which results in much stickier user adoption and continuous growth.

#### 5.1 Fee Allocation
With full transparency, the protocol fees earned during the minting of $HONEY, withdrawal of reserve currency and conversion between $COMB and $HONEY will be split equally in three ways where:
- The first portion will be reinvested back into the Honeycomb protocol, to maintain the ecosystem.
- The second portion will be deposited into Honeycomb’s treasury, to be used to fund future dApps that will promote growth of the ecosystem.
- The last portion will be used to fund the staking of rewards.

#### 5.2 $COMB Use Case
**Payments**: $COMB is used as a form of protocol currency to make payment for Honeycomb services such as minting, withdrawal and conversion.
**Credit Swap Facility**:  Liquidity providers lock their $NECTAR and $COMB in the Credit Swap liquidity pool.  In return, they will receive a share of revenue generated from fees. 
**Liquidity Converter**:  $COMB is used to maintain the stability of $HONEY by providing arbitrageurs with risk-free profit through the conversion of $COMB and $HONEY. 
**Rewards/Incentives**: Users will be rewarded with $COMB as a form of incentive that will positively benefit the Honeycomb ecosystem.

#### 5.3 Token Allocation
In the interest of transparency and full disclosure, 1,000,000,000 $COMB will be minted at genesis and allocated as follows. 

**55% to Honeycomb protocol community**
A maximum of 550,000,000 $COMB will be allocated for liquidity programs, staking contracts and protocol stability. 
- _______  $COMB will be allocated  to reward early adopters of the protocol.
- _______ $COMB will be allocated to Liquidity Providers as a form of reward for creating liquidity in external DEXes.
- ______ $COMB will be reserved for users to purchase as a form of payment for Honeycomb services. 
- ______ $COMB will be reserved in the liquidity converter smart contract for users to convert $COMB to $HONEY, and vice versa.
- ______ $COMB will be allocated for future protocol developments, fund grants and community events. 

**25% to Team, Advisors and contributing partners**
- 250,000,000 $COMB will be allocated to current (and future) Honeycomb employees and advisors.
- All $COMB in this category are subject to a one-year lockup and are 1/4 vested after one year of engagement, then 1/36 every month after.
- Team Fund is primarily used to incentivize core Honeycomb team members to contribute their full effort to the project, as well as to compensate external advisors.
- $COMB will be allocated to contributing partners such as service providers who helped with Honeycomb Protocol in various ways before our launch.

**30% to Investors**
- 300,000,000 $COMB will be allocated to early investors of Honeycomb, to thank them for believing in the dream, supporting the vision and providing the runway necessary for us to succeed in the long run.
- Money raised from the sale will be used to build and fund the operating and marketing expenses in its early years until the protocol is self-sustaining. 
- All $COMB in this category are subject to a one-year lockup

### 6. Conclusion
To conclude, Honeycomb aims to champion the rights of all, but especially those who have lived at the side-lines of society, unbanked or underserved by traditional financial institutions. By integrating cryptocurrency with real-world transactions, Honeycomb hopes to provide users with access to capital in the form of $HONEY, which can be used as a medium of exchange for the payment of goods. The founding team of Honeycomb Protocol believes that with our commitment to accessibility, transparency and the democratization of financial access, we will be able to attract and retain users to the protocol.

What makes Honeycomb novel is that we hope to make the concept of democratized credit a reality in the DeFi ecosystem. Moreover, credit can be exchanged anonymously between users – a development that is ground-breaking in itself. To do so, a stable digital currency ($HONEY) is created to unlock credit ($NECTAR), and as a way to store and transact value. The protocol maintains the stability of $HONEY by adjusting the money supply in response to market liquidity, through arbitraging and efficient risk management to ensure the protocol is always trust-less. All this is achieved using multiple complex algorithms in the Credit Facility, Liquidity Facility, Liquidity Converter and the Credit Swap Facility that work together simultaneously and harmoniously. 

In the future, Honeycomb  aims to build more dApp features that work hand in hand with the Honeycomb Protocol while partnering with merchants and small businesses to create additional value to its stakeholders.
