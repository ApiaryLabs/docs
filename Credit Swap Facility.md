#### 4.3 Credit Swap Facility
Like all DEXes in the market, the Credit Swap Facility  is an automated market maker that uses a constant product curve to determine the exchange rate between $HONEY and $COMB. The Credit Swap Facility is integral to Honeycomb’s ecosystem as it provides continuous liquidity and price discovery for $HONEY. This provides borrowers with the incentive to close their debt position, as they are able to swap their $NECTAR for a value that is higher than their debt, providing stability. At the same time, it allows users to realize the value of their $NECTAR by selling it.

##### 4.3.1 Credit Swap
In TradFi, credit trading is not possible, as credit is created through the fractional reserve banking system and controlled by a central entity such as banks that own and manage credit to be lent out. This means that all the profits made from the creation of credit goes to the banks. With web3.0, the concept of “trust” has been made redundant and this has opened up many new possibilities in the realm of credit creation. At Honeycomb, we are reengineering the creation of credit, making credit ownership possible, and credit trading a reality. With Honeycomb, users can manage their credit by increasing or decreasing their $NECTAR holdings through the Credit Swap Facility, or arbitrage to make risk-free profits. 

##### 4.3.2 Redistribution of Wealth
Due to the concave nature of the value of $NECTAR, each user will value their $NECTAR differently, where:
- Users with larger holdings will value their $NECTAR at a lower price relative to another user with a smaller holding. A lower valuation implies a higher propensity to swap $NECTAR for $COMB (sell) in the Credit Swap Facility.
- Likewise, users with smaller holdings will value each individual $NECTAR at a higher price relative to another user with a larger holding. A higher valuation implies a higher propensity to swap $COMB for $NECTAR (buy) in the Credit Swap Facility.
This difference in valuation will omit tail-end users on either side of the market, allowing transfer of $NECTAR between users with larger and smaller $NECTAR holdings, creating a more equitable outcome in the long-run while benefiting everyone in the process.

##### 4.3.3 Redistribution of Wealth
Liquidity providers are an essential part of Honeycomb’s ecosystem as they provide positive externalities to the community. By locking up both $NECTAR and $COMB, the following is achieved: 
- Reduction of price slippage during an exchange. 
Creation of scarcity of $COMB in the secondary market, thereby producing an upward price pressure which benefits long term holders of $COMB.
Creation of stability in the Liquidity Facility, as the propensity for redemption through the Credit Facility is reduced.

$NECTAR holders with excess credit can choose to be Liquidity Providers to earn a yield. In exchange they will receive LP tokens that:
- Give them rights to a portion of the protocol revenue as a form of reward and incentive to stake their tokens.
- Tracks the relative proportion of the total reserve that each liquidity provider has contributed to the pool. They can be returned anytime to redeem a proportional share of the liquidity for the provider.
