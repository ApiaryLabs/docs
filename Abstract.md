### 1. Abstract 
Honeycomb protocol is the first _community-driven_, decentralized credit protocol that seeks to redefine the traditional fractional banking system and _democratize credit_. The democratization of credit is achieved through the use of blockchain technology, which employs algorithmic smart contracts, eliminating the need for trust. Honeycomb also introduces a stable digital currency designed to complement both fiat and cryptocurrencies as a means to transact and store value. At Honeycomb, we are guided by the belief that credit should be transparent, accessible, and inclusive. 

In traditional finance (TradFi), banks create credit money by lending deposits out and profiting from it. Honeycomb Protocol adopts a radically different approach, instead taking in deposits as a reserve. In turn, credit is created following an algorithm programmed into an on-chain credit facility. As a result, users attain true credit ownership and ultimately the freedom to borrow, earn or swap as they desire. 

Other DeFi borrowing and lending protocols do indeed exist on the blockchain, but Honeycomb Protocol differentiates itself from the status quo by providing under-collateralized loans with zero interest and no fixed repayment date. Additionally, an unprecedented credit swap facility is introduced to give Honeycomb users the ability to earn a portion of the protocolâ€™s revenue, or to trade credit so as to realize its future value.
