#### 3.1 Honeycomb Four Token Model
Honeycomb uses a four token model – Reserve Currency, **$NECTAR**, **$HONEY** and **$COMB** Token – to facilitate interaction within its ecosystem. This creates _decentralized credit_ and liquidity. The four tokens and their uses are described as follows:

1. The **Reserve Currency** is a non-stable cryptocurrency that acts as the base money in the _Credit Facility_. It will be used as a reserve to back-up and give value to $NECTAR. 
2. **$NECTAR** is the core of the Honeycomb Protocol, which represents _Credit_ in the ecosystem. It is a continuous token derived from the bonding curve, whose value is deterministic and an increasing function of the reserve currency. Honeycomb users can collateralize $NECTAR and obtain liquidity in the form of $HONEY. 
3. **$HONEY** is the Honeycomb Protocol’s stable digital currency pegged to the US Dollar. It is minted against $NECTAR as a form of _Debt_ to be utilized based on the needs of the user. $HONEY is trust-lessly redeemable for the $COMB. 
4. **$COMB** is the protocol’s utility token that serves to capture fees and provide economic incentives. It is used to stabilize $HONEY’s dollar value through liquidity conversion. All $COMB tokens will be minted at genesis for gradual distribution.

#### 3.2 Honeycomb Stakeholders
1. **Borrowers** collateralize their $NECTAR to mint $HONEY based on a credit line.
2. **Liquidity Providers** lock pair tokens – $NECTAR and $COMB –  to the Credit Swap Facility in exchange for earning a portion of the protocol’s revenue.
3. **Traders** will swap $NECTAR or $COMB tokens interchangeably based on the individual’s utility, so as to take advantage of price differentials, improve their credit line or to reduce their credit holdings.
4. **Arbitrageurs** will take advantage of the deviation in prices between $HONEY and the US Dollar by swapping $COMB or $HONEY in the liquidy converter to make a risk free profit.

#### 3.3 How Does It Works?
Honeycomb Protocol is a fully automated, on-chain credit protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain [^7]. Like existing DeFi lending protocols, borrowers are required to collateralize in order to mint stablecoins in the form of debt. Unlike existing lending protocols however, Honeycomb is capital-efficient as it does not require over-collateralization, giving its users “_True Credit_” to borrow more than their initial collateral.

In order to join the Honeycomb ecosystem, participants must first deposit their reserve currency that will be used as base money to generate Credit via the Credit Facility. The value of credit follows a deterministic algorithm that grows as base money increases. $NECTAR holders have the option to either borrow against their credit in the Liquidity Facility or become a liquidity provider by locking their $NECTAR along with their $COMB in the Credit Swap Facility to earn a portion of the protocol’s revenue. Apart from borrowing and earning, Honeycomb users can swap $NECTAR with $COMB and vice versa to realize its future value ahead of time. Arbitrageurs can make a risk-free profit while also playing a role in maintaining the stability of $HONEY by converting between $COMB and $HONEY in the Liquidity Converter to adjust the supply in the secondary market. These four facilities work hand in hand to ensure the protocol functions as it should.
